# Math Input Demo

This prototype demonstrates a React component using [mathlive](https://github.com/arnog/mathlive) to render an editable math field with a minimal custom keyboard for fractions, roots and exponents. The component outputs both LaTeX and MathML.

## Usage

```
npm start
```

Then open the served `demo/index.html` in a browser. Typing in the field or using the buttons updates the LaTeX and MathML shown below the keyboard.
