# Math Input Demo

This prototype demonstrates a React component using [mathlive](https://github.com/arnog/mathlive) to render an editable math field with a minimal custom keyboard for fractions, roots and exponents. The component outputs both LaTeX and MathML.

## Usage

Option A – with a static server:

```
npx serve .
```

Open the served `demo/index.html` in a browser.

Option B – without Node/npm: simply open `demo/index.html` directly in your browser (double‑click). All dependencies load via CDN.

Typing in the field or using the buttons updates the LaTeX and MathML shown below the keyboard.
